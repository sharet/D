D is a list of entries, numbered from zero.
with ability to view full list of entries + CRUD for individual entry.
Every entry is simple HTML with some metadata attached:
- created: creation timestamp
- updated: last updated timestamp
- title: title (to display in index)
- tags: tags
- deleted: deleted (by design, entries can't be deleted so we'll just flag em to do not display anymore)

Storage:
- we use no index file so it won't break :-)
- root storage folder is /data/{root}/, where root is derived from primary encryption key.
    this root folder should be created manually to 'register' new user.
- every entry consists of two files: {encrypted-id} and {encrypted-id}-index, encrypted id
    is simple number 0,1,2... encrypted by primary key.

each entry is a separate file, stored as /data/{user key}/{encrypted entry id}
D has index page, showing all entries

Password derivation:
1. apply bcrypt with salt '$2a$12$.12345678901234512345.'. i.e. 2^12 rounds, bcrypt result prefix as specified.
2. take SHA512 of result and convert to hex string

encryption is similar to
openssl aes-256-cbc -e -k {key} -a
to decrypt, use
 openssl aes-256-cbc -d -k {key} -a
